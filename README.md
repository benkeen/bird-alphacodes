## Bird Alphacodes 

This is a quick pet project to let me play with React Native. It'll be a very simple script that lets you search a list of birds to find their shortcodes & vice-versa. Initially I'll just support this year's AOU taxonomy (American Ornithological Union) which covers all new world species. But there's no reason it can't be expanded to search any bird taxonomical in a simple standardized format.
